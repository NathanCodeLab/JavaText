singleton:copy this notes
single object creation and after creating the object we are going to override the object.

class----only one object---use that same object


------------------------------------
return types:
1)if you have the result of your method call in object means you have to give the classname as the returntype
2)if you call the result of the method call in one variable ,you have to give the datatype as the return type.

steps for single object
1.create method
2.we are going to give condition for object creation
3.we have to declare object.--create obj as variable and classname as return type.



        int      age---variable(datatype)
        classname   object---obj--if you declaring as var means-----you have to give classname---(return type)






if(obj==null)-----if there is no obj creation for my class ,create new obj;

    {
    
 obj=new Employee();---------when obj is created --------use the same obj----return the same obj;
}
return obj----will return the same obj







       int obj--variable----datatype/returntype
     classname      obj--object-----classname/returntype
