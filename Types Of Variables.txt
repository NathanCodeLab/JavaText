Types Of Variables:
-------------------
1.Local Variable
2.Instance Variable
3.Static Variable


1.Local Variable:
-----------------
1.it is declare inside the method block or constructor.
2.it get activated when the control enters to the method and de-activated when the control exits the method.
3.it is stored in stack memory.
4.we can't declare any access specifier for the local variable.
5.we need to initialize the value before it use


2.Instance Variable:
--------------------
1.it is declare inside the class and outside the method.
2.it get activated when the object is created and de-activated when the object is destroyed.
3.it is stored in heap memory.
4.we can declare any access specifier for instance variable. 
5.we no need to initialize the value for instance variable it take default value automatically


3.Static Variable:
------------------
1.it is declared inside the class and outside the method.
2.it get activated when the control enters to the class and de-activated when the control exits the class.
3.it is stored in static memory
4.we can declare any access specifier for the static variable
5.we no need to initialize the value for static variable it take default value automatically
