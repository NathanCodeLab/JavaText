if else stmt:
-------------

if(condition)
{
block of stmts;
}
else
{
block of stmts;
}

AND Operator:
-------------
Condition
Input 1 Input 2 Output
-----------------------
1	1	1(if stmts)
0	1	0(else stmts)
1	0	0(else stmts)
0	0	0(else stmts)

Logical AND(&&)
---------------

If the 1st condition is not satisfied then it will print the stmts inside else block.
If the 1st condition is satisfied then it will check for the 2nd condition and if the 2nd condition is not satisfied then it will print the stmts inside else block.
If the 1st condition is satisfied then it will check for the 2nd condition and if the 2nd condition is satisfied then it will print the stmts inside if block.

Bitwise AND &
-------------

If the 1st condition is not satisfied still it checks the 2nd condition and then prints the stmts inside else block.
If the 1st condition is satisfied and the 2nd condition is also satisfied then it will print the stmts inside if block.
If both the conditions are not satisfied then it will print the stmts inside else block.

OR Operator:
-------------
Condition
Input 1 Input 2 Output
-----------------------
1	1	1(if stmts)
0	1	1(if stmts)
1	0	1(if stmts)
0	0	0(else stmts)

Logical OR(||)
---------------

If the 1st condition is not satisfied then it will check the 2nd condition and if it is satisfied then it print the stmts inside if block.
If the 1st condition is satisfied then it will check for the 2nd condition and if the 2nd condition is not satisfied then it will print the stmts inside if block.
If the 1st condition is satisfied then it will check for the 2nd condition and if the 2nd condition is satisfied then it will print the stmts inside if block.
If both the conditions are not satisfied then it prints the stmts inside else block

Bitwise OR |
-------------

If the 1st condition is not satisfied still it checks the 2nd condition and and if it is satisfied then prints the stmts inside if block.
If the 1st condition is satisfied and the 2nd condition is also satisfied then it will print the stmts inside if block.
If both the conditions are not satisfied then it will print the stmts inside else block.
If the 1st condition is satisfied and the 2nd condition is not satisfied then it will print the stmts inside if block.
