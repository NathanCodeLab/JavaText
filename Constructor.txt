Constructor:
----------------
It is similar to method but it will get invoked automatically when object is created.
 Rules:
Class name & Constructor name should be same. 
Constructor does not have any return type.
we need not call the constructor,instead it will get invoked automatically when an object is created.

Syntax:
=======

public constructor_name()
{


}

Types:
======
1)Non-Parameterized constructor/default constructor.(arguments)
2)Parameterized constructor/argument based constructor.

Why we go for constructor chaining:
-----------------------------------
To reduce the number of object creation and memory wastage we go for constructor chaining.

Constructor chaining:
---------------------
It is the process of linking one constructor with another constructor and executing them with current object creation is called constructor chaining.

using 'this' keyword constructor chaining can be achieved
It should be present in the first line of the constructor.
It is used for only class level constructor.

using 'super' keyword constructor chaining can be achieved
It should be present in the first line of the constructor.
It is used for linking parent class para constructor.
